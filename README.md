# MariaDB + PL/SQL

This repository contains sample code for working with [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com) and [PL/SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/SQL).

## Contents

* [mock_onboarding.sql](demos/mock_onboarding.sql) - A simple mock employee task assignment demo using two tables (employees and tasks) to illustrate how easy it is to get started and use PL/SQL.

    **Note:** The demo SQL scripts are meant to be executed step-by-step, not all at once.
